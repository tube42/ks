KS (kickstarter) is a minimal Java library for things that are commonly needed in UI and game projects:

 * Object pools
 * Containers for fast read (List, Stack)
 * Job schedulers
 * Job state machines



The main target for this library is game development, hence it has been designed to minimize object creation.
